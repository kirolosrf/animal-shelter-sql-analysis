# Animal Shelter SQL Analysis

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to manage and analyze operations at an animal shelter. It includes a clean schema design, realistic data inserts, and analytical queries to uncover trends in adoption and intake activity.

## Project Files

- `schema.sql` – Creates the database structure with three related tables: `animals`, `intakes`, and `adoptions`.
- `insert_data.sql` – Populates the database with realistic sample data for testing and analysis.
- `trend_queries.sql` – Contains SQL queries to analyze adoption trends and breakdowns by status.

## Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL 17
- pgAdmin 4
- SQL 

## Sample Analysis Outputs

- Monthly adoption trends to observe peak seasons
- Adoption status breakdown (Adopted, Available, Returned) using CASE statements
- Join operations to combine animal profiles with their intake and adoption records

## Key Skills Practiced

- Relational data modeling
- Writing analytical queries
- Data aggregation & date formatting
- Simulating real-world operations in SQL

## Use Cases

This kind of analysis is useful for:
- Nonprofits managing animal intake and adoptions
- Business analysts working with operations or logistics data
- Anyone looking to strengthen their SQL portfolio
